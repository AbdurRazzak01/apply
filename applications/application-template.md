## üåü Project Overview

Please provide the following:

- Greener & Smarter Driving //If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tagline (one sentence summary)
- ZenVolt is an innovative blockchain-based platform designed for fleet management companies aiming to achieve transparency, carbon neutrality, and sustainability. Utilizing Polkadot‚Äôs blockchain technology, ZenVolt securely collects driving data, automates ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) reporting, calculates verifiable carbon reductions, and tokenizes these reductions into blockchain-based carbon credits. //A brief description of your project
- ZenVolt integrates deeply into Polkadot's ecosystem, leveraging its interoperability, scalability, and security to provide trusted ESG reporting and robust carbon credit tokenization. The platform enhances transparency and trust, encouraging sustainable fleet management practices.
  // An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Polkadot
- Our team is passionate about using blockchain technology to drive environmental stewardship, facilitate ESG compliance, and create economic incentives for sustainability.
//An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project

// of the core functionality
Scope Limitations:

The project currently does not implement vehicle hardware manufacturing.
//
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and clarify any limitations


### üß© Ecosystem Fit
//Help us locate your project in the Polkadot landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- ZenVolt strategically positions itself within Polkadot‚Äôs ecosystem by enhancing transparency, sustainability and providing critical infrastructure for DeFi applications related to carbon credit markets.


//- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Target Audience:

  -Initial: Fleet-operating companies (B2B)

  -Later stage: Individual vehicle drivers (B2C)

//Who is your target audience?

- Needs Met:

  -Transparent, blockchain-based ESG compliance

  - Decentralized finance (DeFi) enabled carbon credit monetization and trading

  - Financial incentives through DeFi mechanisms to encourage sustainable driving behaviors



-Competitors:

No direct competitors currently providing integrated ESG and carbon credit management on Polkadot.
//
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, why might such a project not exist yet?

> **Note**: We prioritize projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications, though all types of projects will be considered.
